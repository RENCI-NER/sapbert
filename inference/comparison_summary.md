## Comparison of predicted types between Biomegatron model and SapBERT model for the split 11 subset of 17687 PUBMED abstracts
- Percent of predicted biolink:NamedThing types (i.e., null type returned from node normalizer) from biomegatron is `50.42%`
- Percent of predicted biolink:NamedThing types from sapBERT is `47.80%`
- Percent of same predicted biolink:NamedThing types from both models is `34.95%`
- Percent of same predicted types including null biolink:NamedThing types from both models is `54.38%`
- Percent of same predicted types excluding null biolink:NamedThing types is `19.43%`
- Percent of different predicted types from two models is `45.62%`
- Breakdown type comparisons between two models can be found in `sapbert/data/comparison` directory.
